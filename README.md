# 🛰 Satellite Orbit Tracker with Collision Risk Analysis  

## 🌟 Overview
This project tracks a real satellite's orbit using TLE data and simulates nearby space debris to predict collision probability using Monte Carlo simulations.

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries  
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, SciPy)  
- Poliastro for orbital mechanics  
- Matplotlib for visualization  

## 📁 Data Sources  
- CelesTrak TLE Data (Satellite)
- Synthetic Debris Dataset (Randomly generated)

###this is my current project I am working on. There are three branches in this make sure you can find the branch when you want to look through them correctly.

1. data
2. src
3. Backup code in the future


**Note: poliastro requires a number of Python packages:
*** poliastro is supported on Linux, macOS and Windows on Python 3.8 to 3.10.

Astropy, for physical units and time handling

NumPy, for basic numerical routines

matplotlib, for static orbit plotting

numba (when using CPython), for accelerating the code

Plotly, for interactive orbit plotting

SciPy, for root finding and numerical propagation
